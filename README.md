# Sudoku Color

An accessible, colorized React sudoku application. See it live at [colorfulpuzzles.com](https://colorfulpuzzles.com/).

Inspired by the board game [colorku](https://www.colorku.com/).

## Change Colors
Sudoku Color was built to be fully themeable with [styled components](https://styled-components.com/). Use the sidebar to change your color scheme.

## Accessibility
All color schemes meet (at a minimum) WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast and everything is keyboard navigable. Even though the original board game used plain dots of color, this web adaptation deliberately includes the numbers as well so that color was not the sole differentiator.

## Win Prizes
If you like admiring hastily thrown together vector art, you should play with some extra determination.

## Testing
Each UI component is covered by a robust set of unit tests.

## Technical notes
The bulk of this project was built pre React hooks. An updated version would definitely utilize those.
